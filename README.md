# wrf-data-request-app
---
a small web app that allows users to more easily request subsets of the WRF outputs.


  Currently these are done by hand, but eventually could be looped into a list of links for download from our 
  forthcoming new local stores with RCS and/or AWS S3 Buckets / etc.
  
  This is a project in development and is not fully working.  

  It is served currently at: https://wrf-data-request.herokuapp.com/
